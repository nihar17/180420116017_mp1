    <h2>About my college</h2>
    <p>
      Sarvajanik college of enginnering and technology is my college. I love my college a lot because it possesses all the qualities of an ideal college. We have excellent course curriculum and faculty members. Our lecturers hold a respectable place in the societies.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is my firm belief that education is the best way to enlighten young minds and it can only be imparted in a good environment having prosperous thinking. Our faculties present educational process/ programs in a congenial manner. All the teachers are qualified and experienced. They teach us with great care and love. What is particularly striking to me about their teaching is the method of participatory teaching. They want more to reach us than to teach us. The method of teaching requires students to take an active part in the process of learning through interaction. I feel proud that I am a student of this college, which is equipped with an adequate library and other facilities for doing good results.
